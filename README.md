## :bulb: About

One day, while eating breakfast I was listening to the radio, they were talking about an app. 

It took out my curiosity,
I wanted to know WHY [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.botondeauxilio.android) was so popular.

I read the comments, see the preview images and finally downloaded it.

My first impression was: It is poorly designed. 
I didn't understand the decisions taken for this solution, the design was basic too.
Finally, it wasn't free, you had to pay before use any functionality.

I thought I can do it better and free of charge.

## :pushpin: Why that name?

Is simple to remember, also I recently consider [Esperanto](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) to name my apps.
